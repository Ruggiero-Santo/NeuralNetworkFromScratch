# Machine learning project
The project was done in collaboration with [Michele Cafagna](https://github.com/michelecafagna26)
For more information please read the report.

## Professor's request
* Randomly initialised weights
* Try a minimum number of initial configurations (e.g. 10 test frameworks)
* The test examples must be provided randomly
* Momentum
* Check the learning curve (draw it with each test)
* Use average gradients (eta/l), especially if using mini batch [NN-part2 slide 25](https://elearning.di.unipi.it/enrol/index.php?id=100)
* Optimisation
* Stopping criteria, in any case stop after too large a number of epochs
* Regularisation
* Use heuristics (slide)
